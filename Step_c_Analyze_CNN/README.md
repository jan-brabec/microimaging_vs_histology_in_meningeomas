# Artificial neural network analysis

This folder contains Python scripts for training and evaluation of convolutional neural network model.

1. Run the script `01_resize_and_prepare_data.py` for preprocessing of the data.
2. Run the script `02_MD_efficientnet.py` for training and testing the neural network model predicting MD on all samples.
3. Run the script `03_FA2D_efficientnet.py` for training and testing the neural network model predictiong FA2D on all samples.
